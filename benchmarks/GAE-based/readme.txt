the meanings of the numbers from left to right in any named picture are, 
the number of benign devices, 
the total number of communication rounds, 
the number of local iteration for each local device, 
the number of malicious devices,

e.g., FL_GAE_results_svhn_5_100_4_5
5 -- the number of benign devices
100 -- the total number of communication rounds
4 -- the number of local iteration for each local device, 
5 -- the number of attacker
